  I think that this homework was very confusing because most of the methods were provided by the teacher and I believe it
	was very complicated. I have made some little changes in the sort method and also adding a method called counting which
	does the same thing as the method timing that the teacher provided but it returns the count instead. I used the timing
	method in my solution for experiment1 but I don't really know if the code provided is correct.
