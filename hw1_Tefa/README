README file for hw1-Tefa

     For the ATM program I implemented the program using two while loops. The first one keeps the program running unless
     terminated by the user. The second loops keeps an account logged in so the user can perform what actions he can. For 
     error handling I've used both try-catch and if-else to catch human errors. Some of the errors are caught in the methods 
     that can manipulate user's input for the program's purposes.

     For the HiClass program I just used a readFile method to put all the names on String array and then a printFile method to
     write random greeting in each of those names.

     (5) Other Information: I could not figure out how to use the terminal to compile the program, so I have attached the
                            project in my homework file.

(3) Integrity Statement:
	I needed help with the file handling in Java, so I talked
	to Dr. Marcelo Cicconet who shared the method ReadFile() in ATM.java
	with me.  The rest of the code is work I did myself.

	The trick for specifying command line arguments from 
	the Makefie is really cool!
