When nn=100, we see that for n=100 the first iterative method is the most effective,
but then for values up to 3300 (except for some n) the recursive method is the most efficients. 
However after that, for values up to approximately 4000 the first iterative method acts as
the most efficient one. When nn=1000 for n=1000 and  n=1200the first iterative method is 
again the most effective however after that for values up to 3400 it's the recursive method. 
Again after that for n up to 4800 (except for one case) the first iterative method is the
most effective. For nn=10000, I get a StackOverFlowException, but the first line of the 
table is printed and the first iterative method is still the most efficient. As a conclusion,
we are sure that the method of circular array is clearly the worst since it has failed for 
all the n to be the fastest one. The two other methods are very but for most n the recursive
method is faster.

When I try for nn close somewhere between 9500 and 9600 I get StackOverFlowException, which 
means that the stack where the recursive methods are stored before returning something gets
full. Screenshots are inside hw6_Tefa.
